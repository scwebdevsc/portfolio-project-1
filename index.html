      <p class="about-me__paragraph">Hello, my name is Darko and I was born in 1991. For I can remember I have been trying to become a polyglot. During this period I made every rookie mistake in the book. Now I have decided to become a serious learner. I have decided to focus on Spanish and Russian. I will start a2 course in Russian and I will try to learn Spanish by myself. In both cases, I will use the method Assimil to learn languages. I will take a course on the website Memrise that follows the Spanish Assimil course. When it comes to Russian I will stick to good old pen and paper. Also, I plan to take the A2 Russian test in June 2021 and the Spanish B2 test is in October 2021. My goal is to pass both those tests. During the last couple of years, I have realized that I don't understand grammar so I won't be touching grammar books to prepare for tests. Also, I have an audio type of memory so I will try to listen to Spanish and Russian as much as possible. I have found the app Tandem and website Conversation exchange to help me find natives who would like to speak with them. In the next 7 months, I plan to take 2 language tests and to see if I can learn those languages properly. The reason why I'm focusing on two rather than one is simple. I easily get bored so I can't focus for a longer period. I will need to switch languages so I don't get bored. Wish me luck.</p>
